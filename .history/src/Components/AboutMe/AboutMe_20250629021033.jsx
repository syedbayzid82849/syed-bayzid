                </p>
                <p>
                    I specialize in building modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I enjoy frontend development with React and Tailwind, and I'm also familiar with backend technologies like Node.js and Express.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond coding, I enjoy activities like playing cricket, painting, and learning about new technologies. I believe in continuous growth and always strive to learn something new every day.
